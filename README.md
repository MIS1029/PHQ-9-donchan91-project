# PHQ-9-donchan91-project
I am working on a Python project that allows the user to record, save and display their PHQ-9 score over a period of time, so users can better understand their mental wellbeing over a long period of time.

IMPORTANT: The PHQ-9 is not a diagnostic tool for depression. If you are worried about the well-being of yourself or someone you know, it is IMPORTANT that you discuss this with a qualified medical practitioner and seek their advice.
